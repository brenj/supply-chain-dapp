Project:  
`Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply Chain`

`ToyChain` is a decentralized application used to track toys through the supply chain; from design to consumer purchase. A Toy and Board Game company like Hasbro was what I had in mind when developing this example Dapp, however it's generic enough to be applied to other industries as well. Typically there would be a distributor in between the manufacturer and retailer, but for simplicity I make the assumption that the manufacturer can also sell and ship to retailers.
